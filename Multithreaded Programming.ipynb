    "* Program contains 2 or more part that run concurrently. Each part is called thread and each thread defines separate path of execution.\n",
    "* Process based vs thread based multitasking\n",
    "    - Process is program in execution. Allows 2 or more program to run concurrently. Running Java compiler at the same time with text editor. Program is smallest unit of code that can be dispatched by the scheduler.\n",
    "    - Thread based multitasking. Thread is smallest unit of dispatchable code. Meaning single program can perform 2 or more task simultaneously. Text editor can do spell check, printing at the same time as long as both action are in separate thread.\n",
    "    - Process are heavy weight task that needs own separate address space. Inter process communication is expensive and limited. Context switch of process is also expensive.\n",
    "    - Thread are lighter weight, they share same address space. interthread communication and context switch of thread is NOT expensive.\n",
    "    - Process based multitasking is not under Java's control but thread based is.\n",
    "* Single threaded system has event loop with polling. Single thread of control runs in infinite loop, polling single event queue to decide what to do next. When queue says something to be done, event loop dispatches control to appropriate event handler. Until this event handler returns nothing can be done. Sometimes that event handler waiting for resource and all other task has to wait.\n",
    "* In multithreaded model there is no loop/polling. One thread can pause without stopping other part of program. All other thread can continue execution.\n",
    "* In single core system, concurrently executing thread shares CPU time. In multi-core system it is possible that 2 core can execute simultaneously.\n",
    "* Thread has several states: running, ready to run, suspended (temporary holds its activity), resumed (pick up from where it left off), blocked (waiting for resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread priority\n",
    "* Java assign priority to each thread. It is integer that designate relative priority from one thread to other. It is useful during context switch (when we decide to switch from one running thread to other)\n",
    "    - Thread can voluntarily relinquish control: DOne by explicitly yielding, sleeping or blocking on pending I/O. For such times all other thread are examined and highest priority thread is ready to get CPU.\n",
    "    - Thread can be preempted by higher priority thread.  (preemptive multitasking)\n",
    "* Thread with same priority may share CPU slices (windows) or voluntarily yield the control to peers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronization\n",
    "* Multithread introduce asynchronous behavior to program, we need way to enforce synchronization.\n",
    "* When 2 thread share some data structure we need some mechanism for synchronization. Monitor is used by Java. Monitor can be think as small box where only 1 thread can fit. Once 1 thread enter monitor all other thread has to wait until it exit. It protect shared asset from being manipulated by more than one thread at a time.\n",
    "* Every object has its own implicit monitor that is automatically entered when one of the object's synchronized method is called. Once thread is inside synchronize method, no other thread can call any other synchronized method on same object."
