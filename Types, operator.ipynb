    "### ByteCode\n",
    "* It is the magic behind portability and security.\n",
    "* Output of Java compiler is not a executable code, its a byte code.Byte code is highly optimized set of instruction designed to be executed by Java virtual machine. Benefits of translating program to byte code is, it can be executed by JVM. And now we only have to implement JVM for various architectures. Once JVM is available for specific system it can run any Java program. Of course JVM is different system to system but we can run same Java program on any JVM.\n",
    "* If no JVM, then different version of program for various architecture should exist, which is not feasible.\n",
    "* As JVM executes program, we gain security. As JVM restrict executed program to create side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Java is strictly typed language, so it checks code at compile time and also at run time. Java manage memory automatically. No need to manually allocate or deallocate the memory.\n",

    "* Underscore in numeric literal `int x = 123_456_789;` Underscore is just used to seperate the digits.\n",
    "* Binary integer literal, We can specify int as binary value Ex. `int x = 0b1010;`\n",

    "### Abstraction\n",
    "- Ignoring the complex details and utilize the object. Way  to handle abstraction is hierarchical classification. Break complex system in more manageable pieces.\n",

    "* Binds code and data together, keeps them safe from outside interference and misuse. It is like protective wrapper which prevents access of code and data. Only via well defined interface we can access data.\n",
    "* Basis for encapsulation  is class. Class defines structure and behavior (data and code), that will shared by multiple object. Object also referred as instance of a class. Data is called instance variable or member variable. Code is called member method or instance method. Each method and variable can be marked as private, public, protected. Private can only access by code that is member of class. Public interface defines everything that external entity should know.\n",

    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "* Using one interface for general class of action. Ex. We can write program of stack which stores int, char, float. All has method like float_push, int_push. Which is hard to remember and use. In java we can specify general set of stack method which can shared by all stack routine.\n",
